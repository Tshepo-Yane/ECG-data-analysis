The heart rate for each trial was calculated using waveform analysis. Each trial was filtered in order to remove the high frequency artifacts that made the signal noisy. A low pass filtered was applied to Lead B of each signal using the function lowpass() with a normalized passband cut off frequency of 0.05. Given that the sampling frequency was 200 Hz, the total bandwidth of the signal was therefore 100Hz. The 0.05 cut off point, which corresponded to 5Hz, was arbitrarily chosen provided that there were no import signals that occurred of the at 300 beats per minute. The function islocalmax() was used to find the total number R peaks in a QRS complex for the entire duration of the signal. The number of peaks was then converted to the beats per minute (BPM) by dividing by the total number of minutes of the signal. This method of analysis proved to be accurate as the values calculated where almost identical to the heart rates provided for each trial as well as during exercise. Time domain analysis is best applied when obtaining time intervals or prominent features of a signal. The major drawback of waveform analysis is that interference can lead to misinterpretation of data. The same waveform analysis approach was applied when detecting changes in heartrate in 10 seconds windows. The signal was broken up into 10 second chunks and analyzed using the same methodolog
